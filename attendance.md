# Hello, students! 
Kindly fork this repo, add your name(s, if you're a group), add whatever idea you have so far (this can totally be changed!!), as well as a link to the project repo, below.
When you're done, go back to your forked repo & make a pull request (which I can then accept, and your changes will be reflected in the main repo). Thrilling!
